            <p>We always review our guest comments through oral communication, guest written comments &amp; suggestion card, receiving phone call, receiving email, guest satisfaction survey reports, receiving SMS, and random checks.</p>
<p>We never can compromise with the quality, to reach the quality we check through fresh raw food ordering by recognized supply, freshly processing &amp; storing, serve fresh cooking food and take immediate response or feedbacks from guests. This process has been adapted since opening time of the restaurant. We used to use less shelf life goods and fresh raw materials mixed with authentic chef selection of spices to design delicious food for our guests. Even our modern menu designing depend on market availability and seasonal based cooking. All these are targeting to create more tasty and nutritious food. Also a careful consideration and selection process we maintained to hire professional and skilled employees who really passionate about food &amp; drink and took extra care to the guests. We are proud because of our repeat guests and we never forgot their wants and needs.</p>
